# Alpha-Pilot
AlphaPilot is the first large-scale open innovation challenge of its kind focused on advancing artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy. Here we a designing AI capable of piloting fully autonomous
drones through professional drone racing courses. In this specific repository, we handle the computer vision task of placing a bounding box around the target the drone needs to fly through. We accomplish this by using a Resnet built using TensorFlow.
